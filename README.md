The Snake Game is the classic snake game that was played on old phones with a twist.

Feature:
1) This version has powerups that speed up, increase score and make the snake invulnerable for a brief period of time.
2) The snake can also eat the red food to reduce size.
3) There is a Co-op mode where your objective is to kill the enemy snake by eating him.
