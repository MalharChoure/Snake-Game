/*

This is a read me file for naming convention that is followed by me to quicly understand variables and their access modifier.

all multiword identifiers use Kangaroo case. All function and variables will follow the following nomenclature

"_identifier" :used to identify the private variables they will always start with underscore and lowecase first letter

"Identifier" :used to identify local variables here the first letter is always capital

"identifier" :used to identify the public variables of a class. The first letter is always small

This of course does not include unity inbuilt functions
